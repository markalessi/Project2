    	<p>This is an awesome application! Don't just take my word for it, try it for yourself! Do you have a lot of movies? A bad memory? Maybe you're like me and have both! I created this app because I am tired of buying duplicate movies and I am tired of wasting my time searching for my movies! This app will help you organize and inventory your movies and make your life a lot simpler!
